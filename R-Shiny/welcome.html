    <!-- WHAT IS EUREKA -->
    <div>
        <h4>What is Eureka?</h4>

        <p> Testing is a major part of what we do at 360i but it is often resource and time intensive.
            Eureka is a solution designed to make rigorous testing easy and accessible by automating statistical analysis and providing intuitive interpretation and visualization of test results on an easy to use platform.
            The core capabilities include sample size estimation, test segmentation for test design and model based statistical analysis.
            Built for the Media Manager, Eureka is designed to efficiently provide test design recommendation and statistical analysis all with the aim of easing the adoption of learnings into our media strategy.
        </p>

     <!-- CAPABILITIES -->
     <div>
        <h3 class="text-center">Eureka Core Capabilities</h3>
        <br>
        <p> Eureka has three core capabilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b> Sample Size Estimation </b></li>
            <li><b> Testing Segmentation </b></li>
            <li><b>  Statistical Analysis and Testing </b></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Sample Size Estimation</h4>
        <p> Sample Size Estimate provides a general set of capabilities to provide estimations on sample sizes required to detect specified lift threshold. The capabilities
          including the sample size calculator playground for quick estimations and visualization of sample estimates, and proportion and continuous variable sample
          estimation that allow for multiple sample estimations.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h4>Testing Segmentation</h4>
        <p> Test Segmentation is an important part of test design as it allows for controlling of what groups are to be tested and how the groups compare to each other.
            The segmentation algorithm will minimize the difference across a set of numeric metrics like impressions, clicks, cost and provide a recommendation of the
            of the treatment allocation together with a visual of the segmentation results.

        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>
        <p>
            Statistical Analysis is at the core of analyzing any tests. Eureka provides a set of traditional statistical tests and model based tests to allow a robust
            level of testing capabilities across various test scenarios. Whether its evaluating a conversion rate performance or analyzing differences in bidding solutions,
            Eureka provides the option to evaluate the data and provide intuitive results of the analysis in an easy to use UI.
